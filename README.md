# Credit Card Fraud Detection - ML Project 

- **Developed** and **Deployed** a Machine Learning Model Using **Python**, **Logistic Regression**, **Google Colaboratory**
- I Chooses **Logistic Regression Model** since it works well with **Predicting the Probabilities between any Two Classes** & as I have
to predict whether the **Transaction is Fraudulent or Not** I preferred this model.
- In this project I **Investigated** and **Checked** the Performance of Logistic Regression Model on Highly Skewed Credit Card 
Fraudulent Data having **2 Lakhs 84 Thousand 8 Hundred Seven Rows and 31 Column Entries** with **Accuracy Score of 0.949 on 
Training Data & 0.944 on Testing Data**.
- I have also Deployed this Machine Learning Model as **PublicAPI** using **FAST API** & **Ngork**. 
- I have Used Ngork, A Cross-Platform Application that Exposes Local Server Ports to the Internet While FAST API is a Web 
Framework for Developing REST APIs.
