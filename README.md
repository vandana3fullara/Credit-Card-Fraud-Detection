# Credit Card Fraud Detection | ML Project 

#### In This Project I **Developed** and **Deployed** a Machine Learning Model Using **Python**, **Logistic Regression** & **Google Colaboratory**.

- I Chooses **Logistic Regression Model** since it works well with **Predicting the Probabilities between any Two Classes** & as I have
to predict whether the **Transaction is Fraudulent or Not** I preferred this model.

- I **Investigated** and **Checked** the Performance of Logistic Regression Model on Highly Skewed Credit Card Fraudulent Data having **2 Lakhs 84 Thousand 8 Hundred Seven Rows and 31 Column Entries** with **Accuracy Score of 0.949 on 
Training Data & 0.944 on Testing Data**.

- I have also Deployed The Model as **PublicAPI** using **FAST API** & **Ngork**. For This I have Used Ngork, A Cross-Platform Application that Exposes Local Server Ports to the Internet While FAST API is a Web Framework for Developing REST APIs.
